Reslate
=======

*A solid backbone for your `.slate.js.`*

`S.src('reslate.js');` from `.slate.js` to use.

Check out `slate.example.js` for my preferred configuration.

The code is fairly well-commented. Take a look at `reslate.js`.

Hyper Key
-------
You should probably set up a Hyper Key if you plan on using Slate and your computer at the same time.

[Using PCKeyboardHack and KeyRemap4Macbook to create a Hyper key.](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/11/shift-control-option-command-on-caps-lock/)

I recommend modifying your `private.xml` to only map Hyper to `ctrl+alt+cmd` (and not `shift`), which allows you to bind both `hyper` and `hyper+shift` as modifiers.
